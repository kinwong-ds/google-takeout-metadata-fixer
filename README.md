# Google Photos Metadata Fixer
==========================

## Introduction
This project aims to fix metadata issues in Google Photos exports, specifically when the JSON file names are incorrectly generated by Google Takeout. The current implementation utilizes a Jupyter Notebook and Docker, with plans to integrate Streamlit for a more user-friendly frontend.

## Features
* Renames incorrectly formatted JSON files to match the corresponding media file names
* Updates the modified date of media files to match the taken date extracted from the metadata

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Docker (optional)
* Streamlit (planned for future implementation)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook using `docker-compose up` (or `jupyter notebook` if not using Docker).
4. Open the notebook and execute the cells to run the metadata fixer.

## Docker Usage
1. Build the Docker image using `docker-compose build`.
2. Run the Docker container using `docker-compose up`.
3. Access the Jupyter Notebook at `http://localhost:8888`.

## Streamlit (Planned)
A Streamlit frontend is planned for future implementation, providing a more user-friendly interface for users to interact with the metadata fixer.

## Code Explanation
The code consists of three main functions:
* `change_modified_date`: Updates the modified date of a media file to match the taken date extracted from the metadata.
* `find_json_filename`: Finds the corresponding JSON file for a given media file, handling different filename scenarios.
* The main script: Renames incorrectly formatted JSON files and updates the modified date of media files.

## Example Use Cases
* Fixing metadata issues in Google Photos exports
* Updating the modified date of media files to match the taken date
* Renaming incorrectly formatted JSON files to match the corresponding media file names

## Building and Running the Docker Image
To build the Docker image, run `docker-compose build`. To run the Docker container, run `docker-compose up`. This will start the Jupyter Notebook and make it available at `http://localhost:8888`.
